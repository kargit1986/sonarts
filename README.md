SonarSource recently released an official first version of a static code analyzer for TypeScript. So if you want to get up and running with SonarQube and Typescript: now you have an easy way to do this.

The supported scenarios are:
* Run SonarTS as a TSLint extensionRun 
* SonarTS as a SonarQube plugin.
